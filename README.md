# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Overview
The objective of this project is to gather earthquake data and use it to create interactive maps of the earthquakes from around the globe. The data displayed on the maps is in direct proportion to the location of the tectonic plates and is based on the magnitude of the earthquakes.

### Results
Here is an example of what the image shows, using the satellite view showing all earthquakes, tectonic plates, and major earthquakes.
